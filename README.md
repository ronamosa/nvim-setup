# Neovim+ Setup 

This repo is my customized version of the awesome [neovim from scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) project. Please go check that out for the original repo + setup.

## Setup 

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

**IMPORTANT** requires `Neovim 0.6 release` version
```
git clone https://github.com/ronamosa/nvim-setup.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed 

**NOTE** (You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of parsers the next time you open Neovim) 

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```
